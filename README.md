## Assignments
The assignments are structured to cover different aspects of deep learning:

1. **MLP on MNIST** - Implementing a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for digit classification.
2. **CNN for MNIST** - Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for improved image classification.
3. **ResNet** - Implementing a deep residual network.
4. **RNNs (Part 1 & 2)** - Understanding Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and their applications.
5. **Attention Mechanisms** - Exploring attention models for sequence tasks.
6. **Word2Vec** - Learning word embeddings using Word2Vec.
7. **Introspection** - Analyzing deep learning models' behavior.
8. **Self-Supervised Learning** - Learning from unlabeled data.
9. **Adversarial Examples** - Understanding adversarial attacks on deep networks.
